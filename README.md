# The path to Golden Kubestronaut! âœ¨

This repository contains exam preparation material i've used and created to become a [Golden Kubestronaut](). Note that this repository assumes that you've already taken the first five (to become a Kubestronaut)!

_Note that this material might sometimes be complete sometimes not, it's a lot of notes to self but still structured to follow the exam topics, and there's of course absolutely no disclosure of the exam questions or anything related to the exams._
