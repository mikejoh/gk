This repository contains exam preparation material i've used and created to become a [Golden Kubestronaut](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/resources/kubestronaut-program/). I'm assuming that you've already taken the first five exams (to become a Kubestronaut)!

_Note that this material might sometimes be complete sometimes not, it's a lot of notes to self but still structured to follow the exam topics, and to be **very** clear: there's of course no disclosure of the exam questions or brain dumps in this repository._

1. [CCA (Cilium Certified Associate)](CCA/README.md)
